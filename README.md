# Ensuring The Website Meets SEO Standards #

This project was an effort to make this website optimized for search engines.

Semantics:
The website was missing semantic HTML. Search engines need semantic html in order to read the most important information on the site and be able top pass it on to the searcher. I added alt attributes to the images and changed the <div> elements with semantic elements that organized the code better. An example would be the footer was listed as <div class="footer">. So I updated it to just be <footer>, which will help with SEO and was less code to write. I updated the title of the webpage as well and ensured the headings were properly numbered. There was also a missing nav link that I was able to connect to its appropriate area on the website. 

Code Organization:
The CSS code had some out of place rule sets, no comments in the css file, and some code that was redundant. I added comments that seperated the css code by the order in which the code appears in the index file. I also changed some selector names in the index file so that I could condense the css code. There were mutiple class names that contained the exact same code. By making the selectors the same name I was able to elimate that unnecessary code.

More accessible:
In order to make the code more accessible to potential customers, I added media queries to accomodate viewing on smaller screens. I added a variety of screen sizes. I was able to optimize the screen for widths of 768px, 540px, and 375px. I optimized the original code for 1080p screens so that the hero image didn't get cut off at the top. 1440p screens are ok but I didn't optimize the code for anything higher since there are probably more 1080p panels out there than 4k. I also looked at the main content of the page and noticed that each paragraph didn't have a lot of text and it appeared quite small. In order to make it easier to read I increased the size of the font. This will also help when viewing the content on a smaller screens
